## Overview:
This is a Sudoku solver that solves a 9x9 Sudoku board. I used [Tech with Tim](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/sudoku-solver-backtracking/) for some of the data display and formatting. I picked this project to intoduce myself to Backtracking and recursion. This was not very difficult, but is a good intro to the backtracking algorithm.
